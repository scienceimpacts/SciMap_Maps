# SCIMaP maps

Code to generate the maps for the Science \& Community Impacts Mapping Project website ([https://scienceimpacts.org]([url](https://scienceimpacts.org/))).

The scripts are used to calculate the following for both the NIH and NSF:

* baseline level of funding, economic impact, and jobs averaged across FY20-FY24
* raw loss, economic loss, and job loss due to grant terminations
* raw loss, economic loss, and job loss due to the proposed budget cuts for FY27.

In addition, the IDC\_map script calculates the loss projected from the proposed 15% cap on indirect costs. All scripts have outputs grouped at the city, county, congressional district, and state levels.

All output files are stored in the output folder.

### from OSF (accessed remotely and not in repository):
The following two files are too large to post to Github and are therefore stored on OSF

home\_119\_workTR: commuter flows with Congressional District Cong\_ORIGIN and census tract Cong\_DESTINATION

NIH\_raw: large file of active NIH grants for fiscal year 2024 downloaded from RePORTER
